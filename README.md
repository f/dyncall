# DynCall

Dynamic method calling support for Crystal Language. Created to be used with [Kreal on Kemal](http://github.com/f/kreal).

## Installation


Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dyncall:
    github: f/dyncall
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "dyncall"

class User
  # Use `share_instance_methods` or `share_class_methods` macro to share methods.
  share_class_methods :name, :surname

  # Shared methods has to have just one parameter as hash.
  def self.name(args)
    "Hi #{args[:name]}!"
  end

  def self.surname(args)
    "Hello, Mr. #{args[:surname]}"
  end

  # Dyncall allows you to call instance methods.
  share_instance_methods :name, :surname

  def initialize(@n, @s)
  end

  def name(args)
    @name.capitalize
  end

  def surname(args)
    @name.upcase
  end
end
```

### Simple API

```crystal
# Getting Shared Methods
User.shared # => [:name, :surname]

# Checking if method is shared
User.shared? :name # => true

# Calling shared method
User.call :name, {name: "Fatih"} # => "Hi Fatih!"
User.call :surname, {surname: "Fatih"} # => "Hello, Mr. Fatih"

# Calling shared instance method
user = User.new("fatih, "akin")
user.call :name # => Fatih
user.call :surname # => AKIN
```
